# Arch Linux Docker Image (Multiarch)

[![Build and Push](https://github.com/Menci/docker-archlinuxarm/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Menci/docker-archlinuxarm/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

This is the Docker image for Arch Linux ARM but for compatibility some other targets are also included. All images are built on GitHub Actions automatically.

The supported platforms are:

* `linux/arm64`
* `linux/amd64`
* `linux/arm/v7`
* `linux/riscv64`

Just just like the official Arch Linux AMD64 image, it has two tags:

* `base` (default): installed only the package group `base`.
* `base-devel`: installed the package group `base-devel`.

And, the pamcan lsign-key is also removed for [security reasons](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/archlinux-docker/-/blob/bc4d9f8ec5bdcbedefc96a2a1beaf33f01c07812/README.md#principles).

# Under the Hood

The Dockerfile uses a Debian Linux container to install `pacman` and bootstrap the Arch Linux ARM rootfs. Since `pacstrap` uses `mount`, it doesn't run in an unprivileged Docker container. I found the tool [`pacstrap-docker`](https://github.com/lopsided98/archlinux-docker/blob/d5a80b90aea37eee43bcc7efeaea69880a4aada7/pacstrap-docker) ([LICENSE](https://github.com/lopsided98/archlinux-docker/blob/d5a80b90aea37eee43bcc7efeaea69880a4aada7/LICENSE)) as a replacement.

After bootstrapping, the rootfs will be copied to a new container from `scratch` (aka. an empty file system), which will be commited as the result image.
